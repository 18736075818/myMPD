This minor versions adds a new mpd_worker thread for heavy background tasks to prevent web ui lags. It also improves smart playlist handling and the jukebox mode.

The new scripting feature makes myMPD even more flexible. Scripts can be executed manual, through timers or by the mympd-script cli tool. You can use the full power of Lua combined with direct access to the myMPD API to automate some tasks.
