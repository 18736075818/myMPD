myMPD v6.0.0 is released. This release improves mainly the support for albumart and embeds an enhanced version of libmpdclient. 

The embeded libmpdclient is based on the latest master of libmpdclient and supports all new tags, the albumart command and 
the upcoming readpicture command from MPD 0.22.

You can now browse and search the mpd database in a album focused covergrid mode. 

The c++ plugin with the dependency to libmediainfo was replaced with the c libraries libid3tag und libflac to extract 
embedded albumart in mp3, flac and ogg files.

myMPD now supports also 3 themes, a dark and a lite theme was added.
