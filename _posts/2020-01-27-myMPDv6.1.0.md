myMPD v6.1.0 adds a new timer function. You can now define multiple timers to play, stop or execute a system command. The new timer function is also internally used for covercache maintenance and building smart playlists.

The jukebox was completely rewritten for better performance. Now the jukebox maintain a separate queue from that are songs added to the MPD queue. This queue is dynamically created and respects user defined constraints as unique tags or song last played older than 24 hours (playback statistics must be enabled).
